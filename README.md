# Similarity-Score-Calculator
Calculates a similarity score for 2 arrays of phrases. Returns a 2D matrix with the score

This code calculates a similarity score for 2 arrays of phrases.
It is somewhat similar to a Jaccard similarity of sets.
It takes in a text value containing the array elements and outputs a 2-dimensional matrix on an Excel workbook containing the row/column headers and the similarity matrix.
Althought the code is written for a comparision of an array with itself, it can easily be modifieed to compare against another array.
